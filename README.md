## Hi, I'm Beau üëã


I'm an aspiring SWE. I started my journey into coding in May of 2024. After nearly 10 years working in SEO & online marketing, I knew that path was no longer for me. 
So I took a Javascript course on FCC, and I immediately knew that this is what I was meant to do. 

So far in my learning, I've discovered a love for frontend frameworks like React and NextJS, while also deep-diving into the backend with Node, Express and PostgreSQL. I am profiecient in Javascript
and Typescript and have also begun learning Python.

:brain: Currently, I'm working on a Full-stack Ecom app, which not only creates a digital store but also a business dashboard so users can update products and details from a centralized location.
My stack for this project
+ Typescript
+ NextJS
+ Express
+ Node
+ PostgreSQL

ü§ù I'm would love the chance to code alongside seasoned developers, especially in web development or AI. If you have an open project you'd like to team up on, let me know!

üí¨ When I'm not coding, I am a passionate rock climber (bouldering) and gamer (Elden Ring, Destiny 2,  )
